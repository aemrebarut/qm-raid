# QM review log

Owner: raid-qm-rev. Implementation owners: raid-qm-plan and raid-qm-impl.

## 2026-09-27 14:46 PDT: initial review readiness

- Read docs/COMMON.md, docs/PLAN.md, docs/CONTRACT.md, contract/types.ts, and docs/lanes/qm.md at baseline 9f0705c.
- No qm-bridge implementation or smoke test exists at this checkpoint. No code verdict yet.
- Requested commit SHAs and safe runtime test details from the QM lead and implementer.
- M1 acceptance: the shipped QM instance creates a synthetic session, accepts "Say hello in five words", and returns a completed model reply through services/qm-bridge/test/smoke.ts. Report credential variable names and configuration paths only.
- M2 review focus: exact Bridge API response and SSE shapes; final reply versus partial activity; cursor correctness; dependency failure handling; agent-originated GBrain calls; loopback binding; no cross-service code imports or tracked credentials.
- Later review focus: swarm group updates, per-unit models, working session URLs, extension installation without QM core edits, and two consecutive demo runs.
- Review records will identify each commit, checks executed, concrete findings, and unverified behavior. QM core remains read-only.
